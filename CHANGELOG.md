- **19:53 · `6b71af4` · fix:** Use the directory/SKILL.md layout for project skills
  Project skills must live at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (the skill
  name derives from the directory) to be discovered by Claude Code. Moved
  the five flat `.claude/skills/<name>.md` files into that layout so
  /commit, /ship, /oss-check, /devils-advocate, and /feature appear.
- **19:53 · `6b71af4` · chore:** Establish the agentic coding architecture
  Set up the foundation for safe, DRY, extensible development:
  agent-kit/ as the single source of truth for conventions, the four-axis
  model, and the systems-not-static principle; docs/ with architecture and
  ADRs; a homegrown changeset system; Claude Code skills (/commit, /ship,
  /oss-check, /devils-advocate, /feature); and CI with typecheck, lint,
  build, gitleaks secret scanning, and a changeset-present check.
